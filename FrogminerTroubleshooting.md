# Frogminer Troubleshooting
## Some basic answers to common issues with Frogminer
### If the info here is wrong/outdated, please submit an issue or PR


## When I try to run Frogtool, I get a red screen and it crashes
Replace [boot.3dsx](https://github.com/fincs/new-hbmenu/releases/download/v2.0.0/boot.3dsx) on the root of the SD

## When I go to tap the button in the bottom left after selecting the face, the frog hops away
Make sure your touch screen is calibrated right (this means you missed the button and drew a dot)

## I don't see the face
Make sure you merged the private folder from RELEASE.zip onto your SD card root

## When I hit Install boot9strap and confirm everything, when I restart the console, its still non-CFW'd
Ensure you're on 11.8, then try again

## When I go to open download play DS, I get a black screen
This is probably a bad sign. Usually this means your TWLNAND is broken. What this means is the part of your console's NAND used to run DS/DSi games is broken. You can confirm its broken by trying to boot a DS game

## What can I do about a broken TWLNAND
You can fix your TWLNand using CFW (this means you have to do either ntrboot or Hardmod) Make sure that if you go the ntrboot route that you either have a DS/DSi or you get a preflashed cartridge, your 3DS is in no state it can flash the cartridge itself!

## The guide confuses me when it says "keep tapping the left options". Is there a video I can use instead?
Yes, there actually is a video you can use that was made to demonstrate during Frogminer's open beta. You can find it [here](https://streamable.com/ti9jk)

Join the Nintendo Homebrew discord or ask some discord with a 3DS assistance channel, and see if you can get help there.
